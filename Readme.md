# Kubernetes and Kustomize for MLflow Deployment

This repository demonstrates the use of Kubernetes and Kustomize for deploying the MLflow platform, an open-source tool for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. Kubernetes offers a robust system for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts. Kustomize introduces a template-free way to customize application configuration, simplifying the process of managing configurations across various environments.

## Introduction to Kubernetes and Kustomize

**Kubernetes** is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.

**Kustomize** is a Kubernetes tool that lets you customize raw, template-free YAML files for multiple purposes, leaving the original YAML untouched and usable as is.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories: `base` and `overlays`, facilitating environment-specific configurations.

```
.
├── base
│   ├── kustomization.yml
│   ├── mlflow-deployment.yml
│   ├── mlflow-service.yml
│   ├── postgres.yml
│   ├── secrets.yml
└── overlays
    ├── development
    │   ├── kustomization.yml
    │   └── mlflow-patch.yml
    ├── staging
    │   ├── kustomization.yml
    │   └── mlflow-patch.yml
    └── production
        ├── kustomization.yml
        └── mlflow-patch.yml
```

### Base Directory

Contains the generic Kubernetes manifests that form the foundation of the deployment across all environments.

### Overlays Directory

Includes environment-specific adjustments. The `development` and `production` subdirectories contain modifications pertinent to each respective environment.

## Benefits of Using Kubernetes and Kustomize

- **Scalability**: Easily scale your MLflow deployment up or down based on resource requirements.
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistency across development and production environments.
- **Efficiency**: Streamline the deployment process, reducing the potential for errors.
- **Customization**: Tailor your deployments for different environments without altering the base configuration.

## Development Process

1. **Environment Setup**: Ensure Kubernetes and Kustomize are installed and configured.
2. **Apply Base Configuration**: Use `kubectl apply -k base/` to deploy the base configuration.
3. **Customize for Environment**: Apply overlays for specific environments (development or production) using Kustomize.
4. **Continuous Deployment**: Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments.

## Conclusion

Leveraging Kubernetes and Kustomize simplifies and enhances the process of deploying and managing MLflow, making it a robust solution for machine learning lifecycle management across various environments.
